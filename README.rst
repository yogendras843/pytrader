Analyzing prices after large stock moves
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I decided that after seeing some of the stocks I was watching rebound after a market drop in October 2014
I would analyze whether or not we could tell how stocks would move the day after they experienced a
large price swing. I called my project large_move_diff_. For all its good intentions it didn't tell me
anything about how stocks would react to a swing the next day beyond telling me that stock movements are
stochastic, which I kinda already knew.
